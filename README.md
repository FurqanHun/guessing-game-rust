# Guessing Game in Rust
This is a simple guessing game written in Rust. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. The user has an unlimited number of attempts to guess the number. The program will provide feedback to the user if the guess is too high or too low. The game will end when the user guesses the correct number.

## Some Thoughts
I wrote this program to learn Rust and practice writing simple programs in Rust.

I created it while reading the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

_Ch 02 of it is literally this game. The only thing i did different is i refactored the code like just divided it into modules that's it._

I'm still learning Rust, so if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to contact me.
